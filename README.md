# Parking-Space-Moniter
Software Engineering Project One 

Mission Statement
The goal of the project is to design a user friendly website that provides students with information on the available parking spots on different parts of campus. We hope to give students flexibility and peace of mind in their daily parking. Since West Lot typically will have available parking the main target areas will include missions structure and other parking throughout campus. If the site is successful students will save time and avoid the stressful task of rushing to find parking before class begins. 

Problem Statement
In the morning when you are running to class do you ever have a hard time finding parking? You circle all the lots on campus only to find you should have just gone to west lot immediately. Not only are you burdened with the stress of finding parking, but also the delay causes you to be late to your classes.
